## Why

As writing might help to develop a better way of thinking and structuring your thought I would like to start doing this regularly and in a systematic way. Those are my own blog and opinions, which might change and evolve over time. I am not a native English speaker and never had a writing class in my life, but I will try my best. If you find this useful good for you, if no - no hard feeling, the only user and beneficiary for this blog is me and only me. 

## How

Markdown and version control systems are the best tools ever.
